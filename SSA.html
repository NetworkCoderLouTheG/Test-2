	St. Scholastica’s Academy was founded in 1925 in response to the urgent plea of Monsignor Prudencio David, then the parish priest of San Fernando. There were five Missionary Benedictine Sisters who came to pioneer the foundation of the school and they were Sister Superior Crescentia Veser, OSB, Sister Luitgard Schanbeck, OSB, Sister Rudolphine Bildstein, OSB, Sister Celsa Rieger, OSB and Sister Richarda Hermann, OSB.</blockquote>

	St. Scholastica’s Academy was also known as Assumption Academy of Pampanga when it was founded. It was located at the Singian residence at the foot of Baluyut Bridge in San Fernando Pampanga. In June 1925 the school opened for elementary students and the following year, the school opened for first year high school exclusive for girls. Each year, a new grade level was added that on March 1930 Assumption Academy had its first high school graduates.</blockquote>

	In 1931, the school transferred to its second site in poblacion of San Fernando Pampanga because of the increasing number of students in elementary and in high school. The second location of St. Scholastica’s Academy was a swampy area. In 1938 the ownership of the school was transferred from the Diocese of San Fernando to the Missionary Benedictine Sisters of Tutzing.

After 40 years, in 1966, the Assumption Academy changed its name to St. Scholastica’s Academy to avoid confusion with the newly opened Assumption College now Assumption University of the Archdiocese of San Fernando Pampanga.

St. Scholastica’s Academy became easily identified as a subsidiary school of St. Scholastica’s College Manila</blockquote>

	In 1972, the High School department of St. Scholastica’s Academy transferred to the barren grounds of Cer-Hill, Quebiawan, due to the floods in poblacion and to accommodate the fast increasing enrolment. The previously “match-like” building has been expanded into an “E – shape” building that houses the whole High School Department. Additional constructions were made: covered court, eating areas with sheds and another building to house the Grade School Department and covered walks. In 1987, a newly constructed building was blessed for the Grade School department. The pre-school later was transferred to a new building in June 2001.

	In 1996, SSA – SF suffered a tremendous drop in enrolment due to the devastation of lahar but was able to recover the following year.

In 2001, the Preschool was transferred to Sto. Nino Building of the Grade School Department

In 2016, the High School and Grade School departments were granted PAASCU Level III accredited status.

	With more than 2,500 enrollees, St. Scholastica’s Academy, City of San Fernando seeks its continuing role of providing its present clientele with quality Filipino Christian Benedictine education.

Confronted with the present realities and challenges of our times, St. Scholastica’s Academy stands with courage to make a difference in society. Grateful for its ninety five (95) years of existence and apostolic service (1925 – 2020), SSA shares the promise of a new heaven and new earth as she “moves on and reaches out” to and with all the people it serves and works with: “That in all things God may be glorified.”
