			<blockquote style="font-size: 20px" cite="https://www.istd.org/dance/dance-genres/street/history-of-street-dance/">
				"Street dance evolved from popular culture and social dance in America during the 1970s and it has since spread internationally. 
				People would dance anywhere that had an open available space: a park, a street or a party. 
				An important feature of street dance is that this was not a style that was ‘learned’ within a studio under formal tuition, but it was improvised in an informal space. 
				As such, it involved interaction between the dancers and dancers/watchers and encouraged creativity in the making up and structuring of movement."

			<h2>Breakdancing (B-boying/B-girling)</h2>
			<br/>
			<p style="font-size: 20px">History: Breakdancing, also known as B-boying or B-girling, emerged as a dynamic and acrobatic form of dance within the hip-hop culture of the South Bronx in the early 1970s. 
		Influenced by diverse elements such as martial arts, gymnastics, and other street dance forms, breakdancing became a fundamental component of the burgeoning hip-hop movement.</p>
			<br/> 
			<p style="font-size: 20px">Characteristics: The dance form is characterized by four primary elements: toprock, a series of upright dance moves; downrock, intricate floor-based movements; power moves,
		which include spins and acrobatics; and freezes, where dancers suspend themselves in visually arresting poses.
		Breakdancing is celebrated for its athleticism, creativity, and competitive spirit in battles between dancers.</p>
